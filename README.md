# React Package Template

A template for creating React packages.

## Available Scripts

### `npm run format`

Formats the code, according to predefined rules in the `package.json`, using the code formatter tool Prettier to you ensure that your code follows a consistent style throughout your project - making it easier to read and maintain.

See the official [Prettier](https://prettier.io) website for more information and docs.

### `npm run storybook`

Runs the Storybook component explorer, a development environment for UI components.

Open [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006) to view it in the browser.

Storybook allows you to build, test, and showcase your components in isolation, making it easier to develop and iterate on them. It provides a user-friendly interface where you can view and interact with your components in different states and configurations. This helps you ensure that your components are working correctly and visually appealing before integrating them into your application.

See the official [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org) website for more information and docs.

### `npm run build-storybook`

Builds Storybook as a static web application.

This is useful when you want to deploy your Storybook to a static hosting service, or when you want to share your Storybook with others without requiring them to run the Storybook server.

You can provide additional flags to customize the command. Read more about the flag options [here](https://storybook.js.org/docs/api/cli-options).

### `npm run test`

Runs the test suite for the project.
